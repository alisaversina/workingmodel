    <p>“They don’t want to work!” That’s what older generations often say about Gen Z — young people just entering the labor market. At first, I simply defended them. I said: maybe they just don’t want to be slaves to corporations? And really — why should a person shape their entire life around business? Why not the other way around?</p>
    <p>Especially now, when robots and AI are taking over. Many professions will disappear in 5–10 years. Gen Z can feel it. Why invest in a career that soon won’t exist? They simply lack motivation — and that makes sense.</p>
    <p>But since technology hasn’t yet replaced human labor, and universal basic income is still just an idea, we need to rethink how work is structured.</p>
    <p>In the traditional system, people can’t take time off when they need to. They work according to someone else’s schedule. They have little to no control over their own lives. It starts to feel like people exist for work, not the other way around.</p>
    <p>Technically, there’s no slavery. But if you don’t control your body, your time, or your attention — are you really free?</p>
    <p>There is another way. A model where people work when they can and want to — not out of pressure, but because they have not only financial need, but also energy, motivation, and capacity.</p>
    <p>Mikhail Tokovinin (former CEO of amoCRM) tried such a model in retail. Similar ideas are partially used by Uber, GitLab, and Wolt — though still in early or limited forms.</p>
    <p>And this model isn’t just for Gen Z. It’s a lifesaver for: people with bipolar disorder, depression, or chronic conditions; parents; the burned-out; and anyone who simply wants to live — not just survive.</p>
    <p>But the system resists. In Germany, for example, shops and salons are closed on Sundays — to protect workers from exploitation. But what about the woman for whom Sunday is the only day she can visit a beauty salon or massage therapist? That’s the trap of the old model: formally fair, but practically inconvenient.</p>
    <p>True freedom doesn’t come from being told when to rest. It comes from having the right to choose when to work — and when to live.</p>
    <p>Just imagine: You’ve got energy? You book a shift, you work, you get paid. No energy? You rest. No pressure, no guilt.</p>
    <p>Everyone wins: businesses aren’t short-staffed; people stay healthy and autonomous; the economy works more flexibly and sustainably.</p>
    <p>And most importantly:<br><strong>Not people adjust to business. Business adjusts to people.</strong></p>
